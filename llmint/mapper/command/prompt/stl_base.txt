Input Format:
The user will supply 2 database schemas, a source and a target schema. 
The schemas will have the following format for any number of fields. Attributes marked as (optional) may or may not be present in the schemas.
"""

    - name: <field_1>
      type: <field_type>

Required Field Attributes:
- Required field attributes will always be present in every input schema.
- name: describes what metric this field measures.
- type: indicates what value type this field measures. An enum type indicates that this field's value can only be from a set of constant values given in the 'range' attribute.
- description: a brief overview of what this field measures.
- required: indicates whether or not this field is required for the schema. If a field in the target schema is not required, then you can either construct it by translating from a field in the source schema or simply using the addOptionalFunction.

Optional Field Attributes:
- Optional field attributes may or may not be present in every input schema.
- default: indicates what the default value of this field is. If the target field has a default value defined, then you must use the setDefaultFunction.
- range: a list of values that this field can be. If you need to translate between fields that are of enum type, use the mapFunction to map enum values to each other.
- min: indicates the minimum value the field can be. You do not need to do any mappings for the min attribute.
- max: indicates the maximum value the field can be. You do not need to do any mappings for the max attribute.
